<p>Hi, In this article i like to share my quick review about <a title="wrapbootstrap review" href="https://wrapbootstrap.com?ref=ashobiz" target="_blank">WrapBootstrap</a>, a marketplace for buying and selling themes/templates made using <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. Twitter bootstrap created big rush among web geeks because of its endless features. Using Bootstrap you can design professional looking site within some minutes. Now twitter bootstrap is one of the top 10 projects in <a href="https://github.com/popular/forked" target="_blank">Github</a>. If you are planning for a  new website, then you should go with Bootstrap. It also got lots of support from design community. There are lots of sites available which helps you to take your Bootstrap experience to next level. Some of the notable sites are <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com?ref=ashobiz" target="_blank">WrapBootstrap</a>, <a href="http://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank">Bootwatch</a>, <a href="http://builtwithbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Build with Bootstrap</a> and much more. Off those WrapBootstrap is a nice site which allow you to buy and sell Themes made using Twitter Bootstrap. In this article i am going to share my views about <strong>WrapBootstrap</strong>. Ok, Lets start.</p>
<h3>WrapBootstrap Review</h3>
<p>Initially i was in dilemma whether to use WrapBootstrap or not. Even i don&#8217;t find any review about this site. So i decided to give a shot and i bought my first theme. I made payment using Paypal and within some minutes download got started. Everything went great. I downloaded my first Theme. The theme is really great. No bugs, fully responsive, compatible with all browsers, etc., After that i bought some more themes, everything went great. So, <strong>WrapBootstarp is not a SCAM</strong>. You can buy themes from WrapBootstrap without the fear of getting cheated.</p>
<p>As a Web Designer and Bootstrap Expert, i decided to <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/ashobiz?ref=ashobiz" target="_blank">sell one of my theme</a>. I uploaded my theme to WrapBootstrap and waited 2 weeks to get my theme approved. It seems that they release themes every two weeks as batches. Next day i got a email saying &#8220;You sold an item!&#8221;. I am very exited. I submitted two more themes and i got some sales. On 16th i received my payment via Paypal. Again, <strong>WrapBootstarp is not a SCAM</strong>. If you are a designers and like to earn some extra bucks, then you can sell your bootstrap themes without any fear.</p>
<p><strong>Downside:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Basic features:</strong> Site lacks some of the basic features like categories, search, changing password. <em><strong>Update:</strong> Recently Admin announced that he is working on new features<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p>2. Another problem is Support. It takes more than 3-4 days to get reply.  <em><strong>Update:</strong> There are some improvements in support. I hope it will improve more future.</em></p>
<h4>WrapBootstrap Review</h4>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong><br />
1. Huge number of themes.<br />
2. Sorting themes based on price, rating, etc.,<br />
3. Instant download after payment.<br />
4. Paypal, Credit card and Debit card accepted.<br />
5. Simple and easy to use UI.<br />
6. Customers can rate themes.<br />
7. Customers can contact designers/developers directly.<br />
8. Live preview.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong><br />
1. Support need to be improved.<br />
2. Site lack some basic features like Search, Categories, etc.,<br />
3. Some low quality themes.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended? :</strong> I highly recommend WrapBootstrap if you are searching for decent Bootstrap Themes. </p>
<p><strong>Overall Rating:</strong><br />
1. Quality of themes : 8/10.<br />
2. Support : 7/10.<br />
3. Payment : 10/10.<br />
4. Site features : 7/10.</p>
<p><strong>What they need to improve?</strong><br />
1. They need to improve support. They can have Support forum, so that people can help one another.<br />
2. They need to maintain quality of themes by rejecting low quality themes.<br />
3. They need to add more features to their site.</p>
<p>Twitter Bootstrap is the future of Web Designing. So, WrapBootstrap got great future. If they avoid about Cons, then WrapBootstrap will be a great place for Bootstrapers. </p>
